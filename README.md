# OpenAi Chat App
### React, TypeScript, ChatEngine, OpenAI, NodeJS
I created a chat application that uses OpenAI intelligence to answer questions from users. The application was created using Vite and React, and it utilizes various APIs and filters to provide a variety of features, such as login authentication, different roles for AI responses, and more.

<ul>
  <li>ChatEngine API for chat functionality</li>
  <li>OpenAI API for text generation</li>
  <li>Redux Toolkit, Node, and Sass for application development</li>
  <li>Git Repository for version control</li>
</ul>
